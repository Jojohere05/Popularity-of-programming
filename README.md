# Popularity-of-programming Languages

This project analyzes programming language popularity by examining developer preferences and related features. Through data cleaning, EDA, recommendation, and clustering models, it uncovers patterns in language choice without focusing on time-based trends. Visualizations like word clouds and cluster diagrams make it easy to understand relationships, helping to reveal why certain languages stand out among developers.
